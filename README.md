Hi! I'm Syarif Fahri.
Currently work as Mobile Developer using Flutter as a Framework with 3 years experience. Producing responsive and high-quality apps. Implement complex UI layouts and be able to have nice animations with custom widgets. RESTful API with http or dio packages and implementation with google firebase to login. Currently using GetX as state management and also learning others like BloC. Familiar with handling issues in terms of UI, data, testing and debugging with cross-platform development. I always apply clean folder structure and clean coding too. I can work independently or as a team and like to be in a collaborative environment and have more passion. Committed to keep learning and be more active.
