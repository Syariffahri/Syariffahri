Hi! I’m Syarif Muhammad Fahri, a Mobile Developer with 3 years of experience specializing in Flutter. I have a strong track record of producing responsive and high-quality apps, implementing complex UI layouts, and creating smooth animations with custom widgets. I am proficient in working with RESTful APIs using http or dio packages and have experience integrating Google Firebase for user authentication.

I currently use Riverpod or GetX for state management and am well-versed in handling UI, data, testing, and debugging challenges in cross-platform development. I consistently apply clean folder structures and clean coding practices in my work.

I have successfully developed an application that has been downloaded by more than one million users, demonstrating my ability to create impactful and scalable solutions. My soft skills include problem-solving, effective communication, and time management, which enable me to work efficiently both independently and in team environments.

Whether working independently or as part of a team, I thrive in collaborative environments and am passionate about continuously learning and improving my skills.
